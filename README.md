# 2011 India Census Data Analysis using SQL

The project explores the data from 2011 census of India. Basic to advanced SQL queries are executed to answer questions and look at insights of the population in terms of growth, sex ratio and area. My data exploration in SQL can be viewed here. This project was built using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

	
## The Data
The dataset is from Census2011. It has data of Indian census conducted in 2011. I manipulated the data in Excel to contain the columns I wanted to work with.

## Dataset Features

### Dataset 1

 
### Dataset 2


## Task
The goal of this project is to explore 2011 Census Data by performing queries in SQL. To derive some insights based on 2 datasets with respect to factors like population change.

## Key Findings
	- Average growth of the population in terms of State Nagaland was the highest amongst all. Similarly Average sex ratio and average literacy was found to initiate our findings.
	- Top 3 states in literacy rate were Kerala, Lakshadweep and Goa. However the bottom states were Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh and J&K.
	- Total count of Male and Female was identified with respect to states using sex ratio and population.
	
	- At the time of Previous census the total population Of India was 4030441188 and population of India during 2011 was 4745417984 resulting in change of population 71,49,76,796.
